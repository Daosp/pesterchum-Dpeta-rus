## FOR EVERYONE ELSE
Greetings! This is a modification of Pesterchum, made because Pesterchum is
effectively no longer maintained, that is intended to fix a number of issues.

The code used as a base is a newer version of Pesterchum than the one in
circulation, and thus has plenty of useful features that can be found in the
[CHANGELOG][changes].

In addition, there are other features and improvements that have been made, and
there are many more planned. Check the [TODO list][todo-done] to see what's
been fixed, as well as what's [planned][todo-upcoming].

### Installation
There isn't an automated installer yet, but the steps involved aren't all that
difficult.

#### Pitfalls
* If you're on a 64-bit system (and most are these days), use those links. You
    can also use the 32 bit versions, if you choose, but you *cannot* mix them.
* If you're on a 32-bit system but use the 64-bit installers, you'll get an
    error along the lines of "not a valid Win32 application", or the 
    installer will simply fail.
* This version of Pesterchum does not come compiled as an executable, and thus
    does not have P	ython/PyQt4 packaged with it. Those are necessary for
    Pesterchum to run, so you have to install them manually.

#### First-Time Install
Download links are for Windows, but a quick Google search will find everything
necessary.

1. Install **Python 2.7** or higher if you don't already have it:
    * [32 bit][python2-32]
    * [64 bit][python2-64]
 
    Be **sure** to add Python to the PATH if asked to do so during
    installation. It means Python will be usable from the console,
    which is necessary for this to run.

2. Install **PyQt4**:
    * [32 bit][pyqt4-32]
    * [64 bit][pyqt4-64]

3. **(LINUX)** Install **pygame**:
    * [pygame download page][pygame-dl]
    * You don't need to install this if you're using Windows. Linux users need
        to install it to enable sound, but it will otherwise work without it.
    * If you want to download this, you should probably do so using your native
        package manager.

4. Download **Pesterchum**:
    * [Download from main branch][pchum-zip]

5. Unzip Pesterchum somewhere easily-accessible.

6. **If you have any custom themes**, copy/paste them into the 'themes' folder.
    You can find this in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pesterchum`, which is the same as
    `%APPDATA%\..\Local\pesterchum`. Copy/paste one into Explorer's address bar
    and you'll end up where you need to be.

    Oftentimes the 'themes' folder doesn't exist in Pesterchum's user-specific
    config folder, so you'll have to make it and copy the custom themes into
    it.

    __If, for some reason, that doesn't work:__

    You can also copy the missing themes into the 'themes' folder of the version
    you just unzipped. **Don't overwrite any files** if you do this - the themes
    used by this have been updated, and the older default themes may break when
    used.

7. Run Pesterchum! How you do this depends on the OS:
    * **(WINDOWS)** Run `w32-run-pchum.bat`.
    * **(LINUX)** Run `./pesterchum`, preferably via terminal.
    * Note that this is made to provide debugging information - so that if
        errors come up, they can be reported to me, and I can fix them.

#### Upgrading
**NOTE: This only applies to those who already have this patched Pesterchum
installed.**  
**DO NOT extract this into a folder containing pesterchum.exe, because it WILL
break.** Read up to **First-Time Install** if you're installing this version
for the first time.  
Otherwise...

Just re-download the [Pesterchum zip][pchum-zip] and extract it over your old
installation, replacing everything that was already there. That's all there is
to it!

#### Having Problems?
I can't offer much help in this regard; if you're getting errors, feel free to
try to contact me, but if you're having trouble with the installers, there's
little I can do. [How to install Python][howtogetpython] might help; failing
that, Google saves lives.
