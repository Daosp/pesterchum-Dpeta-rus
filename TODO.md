~~Crossed out~~ entries are completed :3c
## ADD
 - A proper prompt for choosing a server.

## FIX
- ~~Pesterchum gets stuck on the system tray even after shutdown on windows.~~
- Audio mixer slider in options doesn't always work. (Not working on linux?)
- ~~QUIT not send to server on shutdown.~~
- ~~TLS randomly causing socket to break.~~
- Make setup.py work with 32-bit python.
- Make setup.py work with py2app (might not be required if pyinstaller works better!!).
