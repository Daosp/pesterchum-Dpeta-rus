# pesterchum-alt-servers
Instant messaging client copying the look and feel of clients from Andrew Hussie's webcomic Homestuck. Connects to pesterchum.xyz instead of irc.mindfang.org, since that server has shut down. Custom servers can be configured in "server.json". (This repository was created as a mirror of https://github.com/Hydrothermal/pesterchum-karxi)

# py3_pyqt5
An w.i.p. attempt at transitioning this repo's version of Pesterchum to python 3 & pyqt5 :) (Healivy referenced from GD's py3/pyqt5 commit)
